********************************************************** Python Notes ****************************************************************************
Python is a high-level, scripted programming language that was created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980's.

History of Python:

- In 1989, Guido van Rossum began working on Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the 
  Netherlands.
- The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in February 1991.
- In 1994, Python 1.0 was released, which included a number of new features such as lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
- Python 2.0 was released in 2000, which included a number of new features such as list comprehensions, a garbage collector, and support 
  for Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is 
  assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.
- Python 3.0 was released in 2008, which included a number of significant changes, such as the removal of some features that were deemed 
  to be redundant or confusing, and the introduction of new features such as the print() function as a built-in function.
- Since the release of Python 3.0, new versions of Python 2.x have not been developed, and support for Python 2.x officially ended on 
  January 1, 2020.
- The name 'Python' was inspired by the famous circus group called Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Features of Python:

- Simple and easy to learn: Python has a simple and straightforward syntax that is easy to read and write. This makes it a great language 
  for beginners who are just getting started with programming.

- Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, without the need for a compiler. This makes it easier to test and debug code as you 
  write it.

- High-level: Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away many of the low-level details of the computer system, 
  such as memory management and hardware operations.

- Dynamic typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that variable types are determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. 
  This makes it easier to write code quickly and without the need for complex type declarations.

- Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for tasks such 
  as file I/O, string manipulation, networking, and more.

- Object-oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the creation and manipulation of objects. 
  This makes it easier to write modular and reusable code. 

- Portable: Python code can be run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it highly portable.

- Powerful: Python is a powerful language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from web development and data analysis to artificial
  intelligence and machine learning.

- Open source: Python is an open-source language, which means that its source code is freely available and can be modified and distributed
  by anyone.

Comments in Python: 

Comments starts with a '#'.

For multi-line string, it should be written as, 
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line

or multi-line comments can be written as

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
or
'''
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
'''


by using triple quotes which will be ignored by python as it is not assigned to any variabe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables in Python: 

Variables are containers for storing data values.

x = 4        # x is of type int
x = "Sally"  # x is now of type str

Casting - If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Get the Type - You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Note - Variable names are case-sensitive.

Rules on declaring a variable name : 

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

1. Camel Case - myVariableName = "John"
2. Pascal Case - MyVariableName = "John"
3. Snake Case - my_variable_name = "John" 

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"

If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits

* Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. 
The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

x = "awesome" # Global variable

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic" # Local variable
  print("Python is " + x)

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a 
global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic" # Becomes global variable
  print("Python is " + x)

Data Types in Python

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

Setting specific data type

x = str("Hello World")	                        str	
x = int(20)	                                    int	
x = float(20.5)	                                float	
x = complex(1j)	                                complex	
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	        list	
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))        tuple	
x = range(6)	                                  range	
x = dict(name="John", age=36)	                  dict	
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	        set	
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	  frozenset	
x = bool(5)	                                    bool	
x = bytes(5)	                                  bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	                              bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	                      memoryview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Numbers
1. Integer - a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

2. Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. Float can also be scientific 
   numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10. Example: x = 35e3 which is equal to 35 * 10 to the power of 3.
  
3. Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part. Example: x = 3+5j
 
  
Random Numbers 
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used 
to make random numbers:

import random
print(random.randrange(1, 10)) # Prints a random number between 1 to 10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.'hello' is the same as "hello".
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.However, Python does 
not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements 
of the string.

To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
Example: a = "Hello, World!"
         print(len(a))

To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
Example: txt = "The best things in life are free!"
         print("free" in txt)

To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
Example: txt = "The best things in life are free!"
         print("expensive" not in txt)

Slicing String:
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return 
a part of the string.
Example: b = "Hello, World!"
         print(b[2:5])

By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
Example: b = "Hello, World!"
         print(b[:5])

By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
Example: b = "Hello, World!"
         (b[2:])

Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
Example: b = "Hello, World!"
         print(b[-5:-2])

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
Example: a = "Hello"
         b = "World"
         c = a + b
         print(c)

The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:
Example: age = 36
         txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
         print(txt.format(age))
The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders.

*****************************************************************************************************************************

Escape Characters:

To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.An escape character is a backslash \ followed by 
the character you want to insert.

\'	Single Quote
\"  Double Quote	
\\	Backslash	
\n	New Line	
\r	Carriage Return	
\t	Tab	
\b	Backspace	
\f	Form Feed	
\ooo	Octal value	
\xhh	Hex value

String Methods in Python

capitalize()	                        Converts the first character to upper case. The first character is converted to upper 
                                      case, and the rest are converted to lower case.

casefold()	                          Converts string into lower case.

center()	                            Returns a centered string.

count()	                              Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string. Can give a range.

encode()	                            Returns an encoded version of the string.

endswith()	                          Returns true if the string ends with the specified value.

expandtabs()	                        Sets the tab size of the string.

find()	                              Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.
                                      Can give a range.
                                      
format()	                            Formats specified values in a string. Check https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp
                                      to know more.

format_map()	                        Formats specified values in a string.

index()	                              Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found. 
                                      The index() method is almost the same as the find() method, the only difference is that the 
                                      find() method returns -1 if the value is not found.

isalnum()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric.

isalpha()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet.

isdecimal()	                          Returns True if all characters in the string are decimals(0-9).

isdigit()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are digits.Exponents, like ², are also considered 
                                      to be a digit.

isidentifier()	                      Returns True if the string is an identifier. A string is considered a valid identifier if it 
                                      only contains alphanumeric letters (a-z) and (0-9), or underscores (_). A valid identifier 
                                      cannot start with a number, or contain any spaces.

islower()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are lower case.

isnumeric()	                          Returns True if all characters in the string are numeric. Exponents, like ² and ¾ are also considered
                                      to be numeric values."-1" and "1.5" are NOT considered numeric values, because all the characters in 
                                      the string must be numeric, and the - and the . are not. 

isprintable()	                        Returns True if all characters in the string are printable.

isspace()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are whitespaces.

istitle()	                            Returns True if the string follows the rules of a title.

isupper()	                            Returns True if all characters in the string are upper case.

join()	                              Joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the string.

ljust()	                              Returns a left justified version of the string.

lower()	                              Converts a string into lower case.

lstrip()	                            Returns a left trim version of the string.The lstrip() method removes any leading characters 
                                      (space is the default leading character to remove).

maketrans()	                          Returns a translation table to be used in translations.The maketrans() method returns a 
                                      mapping table that can be used with the translate() method to replace specified characters.

partition()	                          Returns a TUPLE where the string is parted into three parts.
                                      The first element contains the part before the specified string.
                                      The second element contains the specified string.
                                      The third element contains the part after the string.

replace()	                            Returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value.

rfind()	                              Searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was found.

rindex()	                            Searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was found.

rjust()	                              Returns a right justified version of the string.

rpartition()	                        The rpartition() method searches for the last occurrence of a specified string.

rsplit()	                            Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a LIST.  If no "max" is specified, this 
                                      method will return the same as the split() method.

rstrip()	                            Returns a right trim version of the string.

split()	                              Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a LIST.

splitlines()	                        Splits the string at line breaks and returns a LIST.

startswith()	                        Returns true if the string starts with the specified value.

strip()	                              Returns a trimmed version of the string.

swapcase()	                          Swaps cases, lower case becomes upper case and vice versa.

title()	                              Converts the first character of each word to upper case.

translate()	                          Returns a translated string.

upper()	                              Converts a string into upper case.

zfill()	                              Fills the string with a specified number of 0 values at the beginning.If the value 
                                      of the len parameter is less than the length of the string, no filling is done.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Booleans

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False. The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False.

Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

Any string is True, except empty strings.

Any number is True, except 0.

Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None.
And of course the value False evaluates to False.

One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ 
function that returns 0 or False

Python operations

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

> Arithmetic operators
> Assignment operators
> Comparison operators
> Logical operators
> Identity operators
> Membership operators
> Bitwise operators

*********************************************************************************************************************************************

Arithmetic Operators

   +	      Addition	         x + y	
   -	      Subtraction	       x - y	
   *	      Multiplication	   x * y	
   /	      Division  	       x / y	
   %	      Modulus	           x % y - Returns remainder	
   **	      Exponentiation	   x ** y	
   //	      Floor division	   x // y - Returns the quotient which is nearest to the whole number


Assignment Operators

  or	        Returns True if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 or x < 4	
  not	        Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	    not(x < 5 and x < 10)


Identity Operator
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory 
location.

Operator	  Description	                                              Example

is not	    Returns True if both variables are not the same object	  x is not y

Membership operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

Operator	Description	                                                                          Example	
in 	      Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	        x in y	
not in	  Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	    x not in y

Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers.

Operator	Name	                  Description	                                                                                                    Example

Python Lists

> Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are created using square brackets.

Example : thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

> List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

> When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

> The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

> Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value.

List comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Syntax : newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]. The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list 
item in the new list.


Sorting List

List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default.
To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True.

You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function. The function will return a number that will be used
to sort the list (the lowest number first).

def myfunc(n):
  return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key = myfunc)
print(thislist)

Based on the return value, the numbers will be placed in ascending order rather than the actual values on the list.

By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters.
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort()

['Kiwi', 'Orange', 'banana', 'cherry']

So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function.
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key = str.lower)

['banana', 'cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange']

The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.

******************************************************************************************************************************************

Copying Lists

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().
Example : thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
          mylist = thislist.copy()


Make a copy of a list with the list() method:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)

************************************************************************************************************************************************

Joining Lists

There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.
One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.

list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2

Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one:

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)

Or you can use the extend() method, which purpose is to add elements from one list to another list:

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)

List Methods

Python Tuples

> A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets.
Example: thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

> Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

> Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
 
> To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
Example: thistuple = ("apple",)

Ways to change elements in tuple
> You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

> Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with
  the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************

Unpacking a tuple

When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple. But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract 
the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking"

Example: fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                  (green, yellow, red) = fruits

Using Asterisk*
If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the
variable as a list.

Example: fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")
         (green, yellow, *red) = fruits >> red is list type.

If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left 
matches the number of variables left.

Example: fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")
         (green, *tropic, red) = fruits >> tropic will contain mango, papaya and pineapple.

Tuple Methods

Method	Description
count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

Tuple Operation Time Complexity

Operation       Example      Time Complexity
count()      t.count(item)          O(N)
index()      t.index(item)          O(N)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Sets

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, unindexed, and do not allow duplicate values.

                                                z = x.intersection(y) - returns the common item shared between both sets.

intersection_update()	                Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
                                      Example: x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                                               y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

                                               z = x.isdisjoint(y) - returns true if no intersection exists. False otherwise.

issubset()	                          The issubset() method returns True if all items in the set exists in the specified set, otherwise 
                                      it returns False.
                                      Example: x = {"a", "b", "c"}
                                               y = {"f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a"}
